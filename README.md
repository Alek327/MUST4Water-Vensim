![Model Structure](docs/model_diagram.png)

This repository contains the Vensim model developed for the MUST4Water project (Deliverable D1), titled `M4W_model_28062024.mdl`.

## 📘 Overview

The model simulates hydrological and economic interactions in the Italian water system under climate and demand variability. It integrates both physical and institutional constraints into a system dynamics framework to evaluate sustainable water use strategies.

### Key Features

- **Hydrological Components**: Precipitation (P), Evapotranspiration (E), Runoff (R), Groundwater Recharge (I)
- **Economic Coupling**: Sector-specific water extraction, restitution, and dilution coefficients
- **Dynamic Water Accounting**: Blue and green water use, adjusted for climate and demand
- **Policy Constraints**: Ecological flow minimums, maximum concessions
- **Sustainability Metric**: Extended Water Exploitation Index (EWEI)
